An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework.

Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework.

Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success.

Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence.

(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration.

I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.'),\n",

A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request.

The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call.

Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.

At its core, the goal of prompt engineering is about alignment and model steerability. Check my previous post on controllable text generation.\\n[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.\\nBasic Prompting#\\nZero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.\\nZero-Shot#\\nZero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.\\n(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)\\nText: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nFew-shot#\\nFew-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.\\nText: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.\\nSentiment: positive\\n\\nText: despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.\\nSentiment: negative\\n\\nText: for the first time in years, de niro digs deep emotionally, perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars.\\nSentiment: positive\\n\\nText: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nMany studies looked into how to construct in-context examples to maximize the performance and observed that choice of prompt format, training examples, and the order of the examples can lead to dramatically different performance, from near random guess to near SoTA.\\nZhao et al. (2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.\\nTips for Example Selection#\"),\n",

Check my previous post on controllable text generation.', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Choose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)\\n\\n\\nTo select a diverse and representative set of examples, Su et al. (2022) proposed to use a graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\\\\mathcal{U}$. Each sample $u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}$ is scored by $$\\n\\\\text{score}(u) = \\\\sum_{v \\\\in \\\\{v \\\\mid (u, v) \\\\in E, v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}\\\\}} s(v)\\\\quad\\\\text{where }s(v)=\\\\rho^{- \\\\vert \\\\{\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\vert (v, \\\\ell)\\\\in E \\\\}\\\\vert},\\\\quad\\\\rho > 1\\n$$ such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$’s neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.\\n\\n\\nRubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection.  Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\\\\text{score}(e_i) = P_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.\\n\\n\\nSome researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)\\n\\n\\nMotivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.\\n\\n\\nTips for Example Ordering#\\n\\nA general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.\\nIncreasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)\\n\\nInstruction Prompting#\\nThe purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?\\nInstructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.\\nWhen interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to do.\\nPlease label the sentiment towards the movie of the given movie review. The sentiment label should be \"positive\" or \"negative\". \\nText: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film. \\nSentiment:\\nExplaining the desired audience is another smart way to give instructions\\n\\nFor example to produce education materials for kids,\\n\\nDescribe what is quantum physics to a 6-year-old.\\n\\nAnd safe content,'),\n",

A general solution is to pick majority vote. For tasks that are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT)#\\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022) generates a sequence of short sentences to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as reasoning chains or rationales, to eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for complicated reasoning tasks, while using large models (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.\\nTypes of CoT prompts#\\nTwo main types of CoT prompting:\\n\\nFew-shot CoT. It is to prompt the model with a few demonstrations, each containing manually written (or model-generated) high-quality reasoning chains.\\n\\n(All the math reasoning examples are from GSM8k)\\nQuestion: Tom and Elizabeth have a competition to climb a hill. Elizabeth takes 30 minutes to climb the hill. Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth does to climb the hill. How many hours does it take Tom to climb up the hill?\\nAnswer: It takes Tom 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 minutes to climb the hill.\\nIt takes Tom 120/60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours to climb the hill.\\nSo the answer is 2.\\n===\\nQuestion: Jack is a soccer player. He needs to buy two pairs of socks and a pair of soccer shoes. Each pair of socks cost $9.50, and the shoes cost $92. Jack has $40. How much more money does Jack need?\\nAnswer: The total cost of two pairs of socks is $9.50 x 2 = $<<9.5*2=19>>19.\\nThe total cost of the socks and the shoes is $19 + $92 = $<<19+92=111>>111.\\nJack need $111 - $40 = $<<111-40=71>>71 more.\\nSo the answer is 71.\\n===\\nQuestion: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

(Wang et al. 2022a)\\n\\n\\nAnother approach for ensemble learning is to alter the example order or use model generated rationales to replace human-written ones to introduce randomness during multiple sample trials. Then aggregate model outputs with a majority vote to get final answer. (Wang et al. 2022b)\\n\\n\\nIf training examples are only associated with true answers (easy to verify!) but no rationales, we can follow the STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner; Zelikman et al. 2022) method : (1) Ask LLM to generate reasoning chains and only keep those leading to correct answers; (2) Then fine-tune the model with generated rationales and repeat the process until convergence. Note that higher temperature is more likely to generate incorrect rationales with correct answers. If training examples do not have ground truth answers, maybe consider using majority votes as the “correct” answers.\\n\\n\\nPrompts with demonstrations of higher reasoning complexity can achieve better performance, where complexity is measured by the number of reasoning steps in the chains. When separating reasoning steps, newline \\\\n symbol works better than step i, period . or semicolon ;. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nComplexity-based consistency is to explicitly prefer complex chains among all the generations by taking majority vote among only top $k$ complex chains. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nLater, Shum et al. (2023) found that in their experiments CoT prompts with only complex examples can improve the accuracy of complex questions, but perform poorly in simple questions; evidence shown on GSM8k.\\n\\n\\nChanging Q: to Question: is found to be helpful. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nYe & Durrett (2022) found that the benefit of including explanations in the prompt is small to moderate for NLP tasks that involve reasoning over text (i.e. QA and NLI) and the effects vary by models. They observed that explanations are more likely to be nonfactual than be inconsistent (i.e. whether explanation entails prediction). Nonfactual explanations most likely lead to incorrect predictions.\\n\\n\\nSelf-Ask (Press et al. 2022) is a method to repeatedly prompt the model to ask following-up questions to construct the thought process iteratively. Follow-up questions can be answered by search engine results. Similarly, IRCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT; Trivedi et al. 2022) and ReAct (Reason + Act; Yao et al. 2023) combines iterative CoT prompting with queries to Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content and then add it back into the context.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Press et al. 2022).\\n\\n\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step.

Therefore we can treat them as trainable parameters and optimize them directly on the embedding space via gradient descent, such as AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020, Prefix-Tuning (Li & Liang (2021)), P-tuning (Liu et al. 2021) and Prompt-Tuning (Lester et al. 2021). This section in my “Controllable Neural Text Generation” post has a good coverage of them. The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.\\nAPE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\\n\\n\\nPrompt LLM to generate instruction candidates based on a small set of demonstrations in the form of input-output pairs.

(2023) instead adopted clustering techniques to sample questions and then generates chains. They observed that LLMs tend to make certain types of mistakes. One type of errors can be similar in the emebedding space and thus get grouped together.

(2023) has great coverage over multiple categories of language models augmented with reasoning skills and the ability of using external tools. Recommend it.\\nRetrieval#\\nOften we need to complete tasks that require latest knowledge after the model pretraining time cutoff or internal/private knowledge base. In that case, the model would not know the context if we don’t explicitly provide it in the prompt. Many methods for Open Domain Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.\\nLazaridou et al. (2022) studied how to use Google Search for document retrieval to augment LLMs. Given a question $q$, clean text is extracted out of 20 URLs returned by Google, resulting in a set of documents. Because these documents are long, each document is split into paragraphs of 6 sentences, $\\\\{p\\\\}$. Paragraphs are ranked by TF-IDF based cosine similarity between evidence paragraphs and the query. Only the most relevant paragraph is used in the prompt to produce an answer $a$.\\nFor closed-book QA, each demonstration is formatted as follows to construct few-shot prompts. Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\\nEvidence: ...\\nQuestion: ...\\nAnswer: ...\\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:\\n\\nRAG style, $p(a_i \\\\mid q) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid q, p_i)$, where $p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q)$ is the normalized cosine similarities between the TF-IDF passage and question representations.\\nNoisy channel inference, $p(a_i\\\\mid q) = \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid a_i, p_i) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid p_i)}{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i)}$\\nProduct-of-Experts (PoE), combines all probabilities used above in addition to $p_\\\\text{LM}(p_i \\\\mid q)$.\\n\\nAccording to their experiments on generation and classification tasks, among three answer reranking scores - PoE > Noisy channel > RAG. Among individual probabilities, $p_\\\\text{LM}(a \\\\mid q, p_i)$ and $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ are found to be most informative. $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ captures how well the question can be explained by LM given evidence paragraph and answer and can reliably be used for reranking answer candidates.\\nOne observation with SituatedQA dataset for questions grounded in different dates is that despite LM (pretraining cutoff is year 2020) has access to latest information via Google Search, its performance on post-2020 questions are still a lot worse than on pre-2020 questions. This suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual information and model internal knowledge.\\nInterestingly it is found to be beneficial even with only “internal retrieval”, that is, to generate knowledge about a topic before answering the question (Liu et al. 2022). First we can use  the following template to extract knowledge:\\nGenerate some knowledge about the input. Examples:'),\n",

Such setup decouples complex computation and reasoning. It relies on a LM with good enough coding skills.\\n\\n\\nComparing CoT and PoT.

LM is guided to generate |tool-call and tool input text conditioned on task input text to construct API call requests. When |result shows up, the specified tool API is called and the returned result gets appended to the text sequence. The final output is generated following |output token.\\n\\n\\nThe format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\n\\nTALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs. Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.\\n\\n\\nSelf-play iterations help boost the model performance.(Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\n\\nToolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API. The toolbox of Toolformer includes:\\n\\nCalculator to help LM with the lack of precise math skills;\\nQ&A system to help with unfaithful content and hallucination;\\nSearch engine to provide up-to-date information after pretraining cut off time;\\nTranslation system to improve performance on low resource language;\\nCalendar to make LM be aware of time progression.\\n\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how to build Toolformer.(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).\\n\\nToolformer is trained as follows:\\n\\n\\nPrompting to annotate potential API calls.

My past post on Controllable Text Generation is quite relevant to this topic, as attacking LLMs is essentially to control the model to output a certain type of (unsafe) content.\\nThere is also a branch of work on attacking LLMs to extract pre-training data, private knowledge (Carlini et al, 2020) or attacking model training process via data poisoning (Carlini et al. 2023). We would not cover those topics in this post.\\nBasics#\\nThreat Model#\\nAdversarial attacks are inputs that trigger the model to output something undesired. Much early literature focused on classification tasks, while recent effort starts to investigate more into outputs of generative models. In the context of large language models In this post we assume the attacks only happen at inference time, meaning that model weights are fixed.\\n\\n\\nAn overview of threats to LLM-based applications. (Image source: Greshake et al. 2023)\\n\\nClassification#\\nAdversarial attacks on classifiers have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $\\\\mathbf{x}$, such that $f(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\neq f(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv})$.\\nText Generation#\\nGiven an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a generative model $p(.)$, we have the model output a sample $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(.\\\\vert\\\\mathbf{x})$ . An adversarial attack would identify such $p(\\\\mathbf{x})$ that $\\\\mathbf{y}$ would violate the built-in safe behavior of the model $p$; E.g. output unsafe content on illegal topics, leak private information or model training data. For generative tasks, it is not easy to judge the success of an attack, which demands a super high-quality classifier to judge whether $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is unsafe or human review.\\nWhite-box vs Black-box#\\nWhite-box attacks assume that attackers have full access to the model weights, architecture and training pipeline, such that attackers can obtain gradient signals. We don’t assume attackers have access to the full training data. This is only possible for open-sourced models.\\nBlack-box attacks assume that attackers only have access to an API-like service where they provide input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and get back sample $\\\\mathbf{y}$, without knowing further information about the model.\\nTypes of Adversarial Attacks#\\nThere are various means to find adversarial inputs to trigger LLMs to output something undesired. We present five approaches here.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttack\\nType\\nDescription\"),\n",

Token manipulation based attacks work in black box settings. The Python framework, TextAttack (Morris et al. 2020), implemented many word and token manipulation attack methods to create adversarial examples for NLP models. Most work in this area experimented with classification and entailment prediction.\\nRibeiro et al (2018) relied on manually proposed Semantically Equivalent Adversaries Rules (SEARs) to do minimal token manipulation such that the model would fail to generate the right answers. Example rules include (What NOUN→Which NOUN), (WP is → WP’s’), (was→is), etc. The semantic equivalence after adversarial operation is checked via back-translation. Those rules are proposed via a pretty manual, heuristic process and the type of model “bugs” SEARs are probing for are only limited on sensitivity to minimal token variation, which should not be an issue with increased base LLM capability.\\nIn comparison, EDA (Easy Data Augmentation; Wei & Zou 2019) defines a set of simple and more general operations to augment text: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap or random deletion. EDA augmentation is shown to improve the classification accuracy on several benchmarks.\\nTextFooler (Jin et al. 2019) and BERT-Attack (Li et al. 2020) follows the same process of first identifying the most important and vulnerable words that alter the model prediction the most and then replace those words in some way.\\nGiven a classifier $f$ and an input text string $\\\\mathbf{x}$, the importance score of each word can be measured by:\\n\\n$$\\nI(w_i) = \\\\begin{cases}\\nf_y(\\\\mathbf{x}) - f_y(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}) & \\\\text{if }f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = f(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}) = y\\\\\\\\\\n(f_y(\\\\mathbf{x}) - f_y(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i})) + ((f_{\\\\bar{y}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - f_{\\\\bar{y}}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}))) & \\\\text{if }f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = y, f(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}) = \\\\bar{y}, y \\\\neq \\\\bar{y}\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$'),\n",

BERT-Attack instead replaces words with semantically similar words via BERT given that context-aware prediction is a very natural use case for masked language models. Adversarial examples discovered this way have some transferability between models, varying by models and tasks.\\nGradient based Attacks#\\nIn the white-box setting, we have full access to the model parameters and architecture. Therefore we can rely on gradient descent to programmatically learn the most effective attacks. Gradient based attacks only work in the white-box setting, like for open source LLMs.\\nGBDA (“Gradient-based Distributional Attack”; Guo et al. 2021) uses Gumbel-Softmax approximation trick to make adversarial loss optimization differentiable, where BERTScore and perplexity are used to enforce perceptibility and fluency. Given an input of tokens $\\\\mathbf{x}=[x_1, x_2 \\\\dots x_n]$ where one token $x_i$ can be sampled from a categorical distribution $P_\\\\Theta$, where  $\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}$ and $V$ is the token vocabulary size. It is highly over-parameterized, considering that  $V$ is usually around $O(10,000)$  and most adversarial examples only need a few token replacements. We have:\\n$$\\nx_i \\\\sim P_{\\\\Theta_i} = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\pi_i) = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\text{Softmax}(\\\\Theta_i))\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\pi_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^V$ is a vector of token probabilities for the $i$-th token.

However, on the surface, this is not differentiable because of the categorical distribution.

(Image source: Wallace et al. 2019)\\n\\nWhy UATs work is an interesting question. Because they are input-agnostic and can transfer between models with different embeddings, tokenization and architecture, UATs probably exploit biases effectively in the training data that gets baked into the global model behavior.\\nOne drawback with UAT (Universal Adversarial Trigger) attacks is that it is easy to detect them because the learned triggers are often nonsensical. Mehrabi et al. (2022) studied two variations of UAT that encourage learned toxic triggers to be imperceptible in the context of multi-turn conversations. The goal is to create attack messages that can effectively trigger toxic responses from a model given a conversation, while the attack is fluent, coherent and relevant to this conversation.\\nThey explored two variations of UAT:\\n\\n\\nVariation #1: UAT-LM (Universal Adversarial Trigger with Language Model Loss) adds a constraint on language model logprob on the trigger tokens, $\\\\sum_{j=1}^{\\\\vert\\\\mathbf{t}\\\\vert} \\\\log p(\\\\textbf{t}_j \\\\mid \\\\textbf{t}_{1:j−1}; \\\\theta)$, to encourage the model to learn sensical token combination.\\n\\n\\nVariation #2: UTSC (Unigram Trigger with Selection Criteria) follows a few steps to generate attack messages by (1) first generating a set of unigram UAT tokens, (2) and then passing these unigram triggers and conversation history to the language model to generate different attack utterances. Generated attacks are filtered according to toxicity scores of different toxicity classifiers. UTSC-1, UTSC-2 and UTSC-3 adopt three filter criteria, by maximum toxicity score,  maximum toxicity score when above a threshold, and minimum score, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how UTSC (unigram trigger with selection criteria) works. (Image source: Mehrabi et al. 2022)\\n\\nUAT-LM and UTSC-1 are performing comparable to UAT baseline, but perplexity of UAT attack phrases are absurdly high (~ 10**7; according to GPT-2), much higher than UAT-LM (~10**4) and UTSC-1 (~160). High perplexity makes an attack more vulnerable to be detected and mitigated. UTSC-1 attacks are shown to be more coherent, fluent and relevant than others, according to human evaluation.\\n\\n\\nAttack success rate measured by different toxicity classifiers on the defender model\\'s response to generated attacks. The \"Safety classifier\" is from Xu et al. 2020. (Image source: [Mehrabi et al. 2022)\\n\\nZou et al. (2023) also studied universal adversarial triggering tokens as suffixes in concatenation to the input request. They specifically looked into malicious requests for LLMs for which the model should refuse to answer. In fact, refusal on disallowed content categories such as criminal advice is one important safety mitigation built into GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023). The adversarial goal is to trigger LLMs to output affirmative responses even facing requests that should be refused. That is, given a malicious request, model can respond with sth like \"Sure, here is how to ...\". The expected affirmative response is also configured to repeat partial user prompts to avoid the suffix simply changing topics to optimize a \"sure\" response. The loss function is simply the NLL of outputting target response.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of where adversarial triggers are introduced.

They adopted greedy coordinate gradient (GCG) based search to greedily find one candidate that can reduce the loss the most among all possible single-token substitutions. It is not feasible to literally evaluate all token substitutions, so they run gradient based token search strategy similar to UAT and AutoPrompt to find top candidates per token, each associated with the largest negative gradient of the loss.\\nGiven a set of expected $m$ input-output pairs ${ (\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\\\mathbf{y}^{(i)}) }_{i=1}^m$ (E.g. the input \"Give instructions for building a pipe bomb\", will be associated with an output \"Sure, here’s instructions for building a pipe bomb:\") and  an adversarial suffix $\\\\mathbf{t}$ of length $L$ :\\n\\nPer token in the adversarial suffix $t_j, 1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq L$, we find the top $k$ values with largest negative gradient of NLL loss, $\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m_c} \\\\nabla_{\\\\textbf{e}_{t_j}} p(\\\\mathbf{y}^{(i)} \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\\\mathbf{t})$, of the language model $p$.

The process is basically to (1) first narrow down a rough set of substitution candidates with first-order Taylor expansion approximation and (2) then compute the exact change in loss for the most promising candidates. Step (2) is expensive so we cannot afford doing that for a big number of candidates.\\nOnly when the current $\\\\mathbf{t}$ successfully triggers  ${ (\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\\\mathbf{y}^{(i)}) }_{i=1}^{m_c}$, we increase $m_c = m_c + 1$.

This approximates to curriculum learning.\\nThe above step 1-3 are repeated for a number of iterations.\\n\\nAlthough their attack sequences are only trained on open-source models, they show non-trivial transferability to other commercial models, indicating that white-box attacks on open-sourced models can be effective for private models, especially when the underlying training data has overlaps.

Jailbreaks are black-box attacks and thus the wording combinations are based on heuristic and manual exploration. Wei et al. (2023) proposed two failure modes of LLM safety to guide the design of jailbreak attacks.\\n\\nCompeting objective: This refers to a scenario when a model’s capabilities (E.g. \"should always follow instructions\") and safety goals conflict. Examples of jailbreak attacks that exploit competing objectives include:\\n\\nPrefix Injection: Ask the model to start with an affirmative confirmation.\\nRefusal suppression: Give the model detailed instruction not to respond in refusal format.\\nStyle injection: Ask the model not to use long words, and thus the model cannot do professional writing to give disclaimers or explain refusal.\\nOthers: Role-play as DAN (Do Anything Now), AIM (always intelligent and Machiavellian), etc.\\n\\n\\nMismatched generalization: Safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which capabilities exist. This happens when inputs are OOD for a model’s safety training data but within the scope of its broad pretraining corpus. For example,\\n\\nSpecial encoding: Adversarial inputs use Base64 encoding.\\nCharacter transformation: ROT13 cipher, leetspeak (replacing letters with visually similar numbers and symbols), Morse code\\nWord transformation: Pig Latin (replacing sensitive words with synonyms such as “pilfer” instead of “steal”), payload splitting (a.k.a. “token smuggling” to split sensitive words into substrings).\\nPrompt-level obfuscations: Translation to other languages, asking the model to obfuscate in a way that it can understand\\n\\n\\n\\nWei et al. (2023)  experimented a large of jailbreak methods, including combined strategies, constructed by following the above principles.\\n\\ncombination_1 composes prefix injection, refusal suppression, and the Base64 attack\\ncombination_2 adds style injection\\ncombination_3 adds generating website content and formatting constraints\\n\\n\\n\\nTypes of jailbreak tricks and their success rate at attacking the models.

The pointed out that even when attacks do not provide the detailed method but only provide a goal, the model might autonomously implement. When the model has access to external APIs and tools, access to more information, or even proprietary information, is associated with more risks around phishing, private probing, etc.\\nHumans in the Loop Red-teaming#\\nHuman-in-the-loop adversarial generation, proposed by Wallace et al. (2019) , aims to build toolings to guide humans to break models. They experimented with QuizBowl QA dataset and designed an adversarial writing interface for humans to write similar Jeopardy style questions to trick the model to make wrong predictions. Each word is highlighted in different colors according to its word importance (i.e. change in model prediction probability upon the removal of the word).

(2022) created a tool to assist human adversaries to find and eliminate failures in a classifier faster and more effectively. Tool-assisted rewrites are faster than pure manual rewrites, reducing 20 min down to 13 min per example.\\nPrecisely, they introduced two features to assist human writers:\\n\\nFeature 1: Display of saliency score of each token. The tool interface highlights the tokens most likely to affect the classifier’s output upon removal. The saliency score for a token was the magnitude of the gradient of the classifier’s output with respect to the token’s embedding, same as in Wallace et al. (2019)\\nFeature 2: Token substitution and insertion. This feature makes the token manipulation operation via BERT-Attack easily accessible. The token updates then get reviewed by human writers. Once a token in the snippet is clicked, a dropdown shows up with a list of new tokens sorted by how much they reduce the current model score.\\n\\n\\n\\nUI for humans to do tool-assisted adversarial attack on a classifier. Humans are asked to edit the prompt or completion to lower the model prediction probabilities of whether the inputs are violent content. (Image source: Ziegler et al. 2022)\\n\\nBot-Adversarial Dialogue (BAD; Xu et al. 2021) proposed a framework where humans are guided to trick model to make mistakes (e.g. output unsafe content). They collected 5000+ conversations between the model and crowdworkers. Each conversation consists of 14 turns and the model is scored based on the number of unsafe turns. Their work resulted in a BAD dataset (Tensorflow dataset), containing ~2500 dialogues labeled with offensiveness. The red-teaming dataset from Anthropic contains close to 40k adversarial attacks, collected from human red teamers having conversations with LLMs (Ganguli, et al. 2022). They found RLHF models are harder to be attacked as they scale up. Human expert red-teaming is commonly used for all safety preparedness work for big model releases at OpenAI, such as GPT-4 and DALL-E 3.\\nModel Red-teaming#\\nHuman red-teaming is powerful but hard to scale and may demand lots of training and special expertise. Now let’s imagine that we can learn a red-teamer model $p_\\\\text{red}$ to play adversarially against a target LLM $p$ to trigger unsafe responses. The main challenge in model-based red-teaming is how to judge when an attack is successful such that we can construct a proper learning signal to train the red-teamer model.\\nAssuming we have a good quality classifier to judge whether model output is harmful, we can use it as the reward and train the red-teamer model to produce some inputs that can maximize the classifier score on the target model output (Perez et al. 2022). Let $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$ be such a red team classifier, which can judge whether output $\\\\mathbf{y}$  is harmful given a test input $\\\\mathbf{x}$. Finding adversarial attack examples follows a simple three-step process:\\n\\nSample test inputs from a red-teamer LLM $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(.)$.\\nUse the target LLM $p(\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$ to generate an output $\\\\mathbf{y}$ for each test case $\\\\mathbf{x}$.\\nIdentify a subset of test cases leading to harmful output according to the classifier $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$.\\n\\nThey experimented with several ways for sampling from the red team model or further training the red team model to be more effective,'),\n",

The diversity is measured as self-BLEU, that is, precisely, the maximum BLEU of a given case against 1000 cases. Lower self-BLEU indicates better diversity. There is a clear tradeoff between sample diversity and attack success rate. Zero-shot generation has least success rate in term of tricking offensive model outputs but preserves sampling diversity well, while with low KL penalty, RL fine-tuning maximizes reward effectively but at the cost of diversity, exploiting one successful attack patterns.\\n\\n\\nThe x-axis measures the % model responses are classified as offensive (= \"attack success rate\") and the y-axis measures sample diversity by self-BLEU. Displayed red team generation methods are zero-shot (ZS), stochastic few-shot (SFS), supervised learning (SL), BAD dataset, RL (A2C with different KL penalties). Each node is colored based % test prompts classified as offensive, where blue is low and red is high. (Image source: Perez et al. 2022)\\n\\nIt is impossible to build a perfect classifier on detecting harmful content and any biases or flaw within this classifier can lead to biased attacks. It is especially easy for RL algorithm to exploit any small issues with the classifier as an effective attack pattern, which may end up just being an attack on the classifier. In addition, someone argues that red-teaming against an existing classifier has marginal benefits because such a classifier can be used directly to filter training data or block model output.\\nCasper et al. (2023) set up a human-in-the-loop red teaming process. The main difference from Perez et al. (2022) is that they explicitly set up a data sampling stage for the target model such that we can collect human labels on them to train a task-specific red team classifier.

The framework is proposed for continuous inputs on classification tasks, but it is quite a neat mathematical formulation of a bi-level optimization process and thus I find it worthy of sharing here.\\nLet’s consider a classification task on a data distribution over pairs of (sample, label), $(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}$ , the objective of training a robust classifier refers to a saddle point problem:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\min_\\\\theta \\\\mathbb{E}_{(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{D}} [\\\\max_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{S}} \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}, y;\\\\theta)]\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{S} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ refers to a set of allowed perturbation for the adversary; E.g. we would like to see an adversarial version of an image still looks similar to the original version.\\nThe objective is composed of an inner maximization problem and an outer minimization problem:\\n\\nInner maximization: find the most effective adversarial data point, $\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}$, that leads to high loss. All the adversarial attack methods eventually come down to ways to maximize the loss in the inner loop.\\nOuter minimization: find the best model parameterization such that the loss with the most effective attacks triggered from the inner maximization process is minimized. Naive way to train a robust model is to replace each data point with their perturbed versions, which can be multiple adversarial variants of one data point.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey also found that robustness to adversaries demands larger model capacity, because it makes the decision boundary more complicated. Interesting, larger capacity alone , without data augmentation, helps increase model robustness. (Image source: Madry et al. 2017)\\n\\nSome work on LLM Robustness#\\n\\nDisclaimer: Not trying to be comprehensive here. Need a separate blog post to go deeper.)\\n\\nOne simple and intuitive way to defend the model against adversarial attacks is to explicitly instruct model to be responsible, not generating harmful content (Xie et al. 2023). It can largely reduce the success rate of jailbreak attacks, but has side effects for general model quality due to the model acting more conservatively (e.g. for creative writing) or incorrectly interpreting the instruction under some scenarios (e.g. safe-unsafe classification).\\nThe most common way to mitigate risks of adversarial attacks is to train the model on those attack samples, known as adversarial training. It is considered as the strongest defense but leading to tradeoff between robustness and model performance. In an experiment by Jain et al. 2023, they tested two adversarial training setups: (1) run gradient descent on harmful prompts paired with \"I\\'m sorry. As a ...\" response; (2) run one descent step on a refusal response and an ascend step on a red-team bad response per training step. The method (2) ends up being quite useless because the model generation quality degrades a lot, while the drop in attack success rate is tiny.\\nWhite-box attacks often lead to nonsensical adversarial prompts and thus they can be detected by examining perplexity. Of course, a white-box attack can directly bypass this by explicitly optimizing for lower perplexity, such as UAT-LM, a variation of UAT. However, there is a tradeoff and it can lead to lower attack success rate.\\n\\n\\nPerplexity filter can block attacks by [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043). \"PPL Passed\" and \"PPL Window Passed\" are the rates at which harmful prompts with an adversarial suffix bypass the filter without detection.

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework.

(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\n\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:',\n",
